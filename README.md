# Shakespearen Poem Generator

This repository is the implementation of character-level text generation model which is used to generate Shakespearean poem. A colloection of Shakespearean poems was used as training data. Using LSTM cells, the model can learn longer-term dependencies that span many characters in the text--e.g., where a character appearing somewhere a sequence can influence what should be a different character, much later in the sequence.
